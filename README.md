# weather-monitoring
I have developed a weather monitoring system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This system allows users to get real-time weather updates for any location.

Features:

User Interface: The interface is designed with HTML and styled using CSS to ensure a clean and user-friendly experience.
Weather Data: JavaScript is used to fetch weather data from a reliable API, displaying current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Search Functionality: Users can search for weather updates by entering the name of a city or allowing the system to detect their location automatically.
Responsive Design: The system is fully responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
This project showcases my skills in front-end development and my ability to integrate external APIs to create functional and interactive web applications.
